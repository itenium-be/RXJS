RXJS
====

Once [Observable](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/issues/6367) has been standardized,
update this repo to RXJS v8.


Node: v22.1.0

```ps1
cd exercises
npm install
npm start
```

Update `exercises/index.ts` to switch between different exercises!


For the Angular RXJS exercises see `exercises-angular/README.md`

TODO
----

- RXJS example hot vs cold --> & check network tab
- Something to vizualize the marbles? It's builtin RXJS with TestScheduler?
- Finalize the pptx with some additional infos


Theorie Angular:
- Do not use subscribe to set fields, use the AsyncPipe
- Do not reset an observable, declare it once in ctor or ngOnInit and take everything relevant into account


Extra Angular
- Use AbstractControl.valueChange / statusChange
--> Categories & SubCategories --> SubCategories depends on Category selection


RXJS:
- User enters search needle:
- Small initial debounce & then a search goes to the backend
- Cancel the API call when the current search string does not include the API needle & relaunch new with current needle
- Once results have returned from the backend and the current search string > used needle, show those results
- After that normal debounce
